Flowing through code looking to both become more familar with and correct anything that needs to be changed. . . (1/11/03)
I didn't change anything from above, but I'm adding mutations. (1/13/02)
Mutations involves adding lots of different things - auras, wraithform and
ghosts, other new functions and pets. Which is what I'm about to add now. (1/16/03)
fixed the monster.txt file problem. yay. Much thanks to konijn. (1/17/03)
Finished implimenting pets, and Fixed several bugs causing the game to crash with an access fault (1/18/03)
Pets implimented somewhat (The are not very bright. Sometimes they will hit you. Sometimes they will hit each other. And you don't get experience for the kills.) (1/19/03)

Added anarchist and mutate flags. Now when gaining levels certain races and classes will gain mutations. (1/20/03)
added Rakshasa powers. There were three of them and it took me a moment to figure out how to work them. (1/20/03) 
Fixed the text file end characters problem (1/20/03)
HACKED in the message compression routine. Made it painfully obvious after this release I'm going to have to diff to 3.0.2[v] :-/ (go bigscreen though.) (1/21/03)
Started with the first B-Movie monster. King kong.  (1/21/03)
Finished coding in monster auras. Auras should work correctly now for both player and monster (1/21/03)

Fixed a bug in cmd-item, that would cause the next command to be limited to item_tester_hook_tonic if you were an automata, and tried to drink. (1/10/03)
The honorable and esteemed KUSUNOSE Toru <kusunose@hcn.zaq.ne.jp> was generous enought to send in a patch for a _HUGE_ bug after character creation, and diffs to make it eaiser to compile for windows out of the box. His help and patch are much appreaceated. (1/10/03)
Made #define Macintosh, defined in the compiler and not the source. (1/10/03)

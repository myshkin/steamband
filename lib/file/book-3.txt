The Martian Slave Race

"Their undeniable preference for men as their source of nourishment is partly explained by the nature of the remains of the victims they had brought with them as provisions from Mars. These creatures, to judge from the shrivelled remains that have fallen into human hands, were bipeds with flimsy, siliceous skeletons (almost like those of the siliceous sponges) and feeble musculature, standing about six feet high and having round, erect heads, and large eyes in flinty sockets. Two or three of these seem to have been brought in each cylinder, and all were killed before earth was reached. It was just as well for them, for the mere attempt to stand upright upon our planet would have broken every bone in their bodies." 

At this point it might be appropriate to describe the creatures which the Martians brought with them for food on their long journey. Essentially hominid in appearance, the specimens recovered from the cylinders measured well over six feet in height, but due to the gentler gravity of Mars their muscular and skeletal structure is relatively weak compared to those of humans. In fact their body weight is approximately the same as that of a human, only their tall frames mean that they appear to be thin, spindly creatures, almost flimsy. They walk erect, and have two arms and two legs, each limb having four digits - three dextrous fingers and an opposable thumb on each hand, four long, evenly-sized toes on each foot. The chest cavity is relatively oversized, giving the bipeds' physique a passing resemblance to that of a greyhound. Most of its volume is occupied by the large lungs with which the biped breaths the thin atmosphere of Mars. There is a single eardrum situated at the base of the skull, and the eyes are large with pronounced brow ridges. The iris is a deep red, almost maroon, coloured so by the blood vessels within. It is curious to note that the Martian bipeds possess almost no pigmentation at all. The skin is extremely pale, almost translucent, hairless and very smooth. The bipeds, like the Martians, lack visible olfactory apparatus, the organs governing their sense of smell being located at the back of the throat. The size of the cranial cavity indicates that these creatures possess an intellect comparable with that of a human. 

There were few if any specimens of this creature left alive at the time of the Martians’ arrival on Earth, and it has been concluded that, even were one of these creatures to survive any length of time on Earth, the unfortunate wretch would be incapable of anything beyond the feeblest of movement.

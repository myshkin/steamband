Hi.

This is some advice for people looking to port Steamband.

I am not a coder, and I do not know C. :-) This of course makes everyone's job more difficult. All of the makefiles are out of date, and I'm not sure how to update them at all. Here are the files that will almost certainly be missing from your makefile.

classpower.c
level.c
mspells1.c
mutation.c
pets.c
spells3.c

You should also note that xxxload1.c and xxxrandard.c are _NOT_ to be compiled. 
If you _do_ compile for another system, please email me the makefile at campbell@oook.cz. Also, if you could upload your compile to clockwork (if there hasn't been a copy of your systems compile already uploaded), and email me to let me know, so I can post a copy of your compile on my web page. :-)

I can't tell everyone how much I appreciate all the help that has been given to me with this project. And how thankful I am for everyone's continued patience as I learn C. 

Good luck.
-Campbell
